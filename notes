so i need to not only look at the starting loc but every loc, and get the time whether its a calc by lat/long or get time from
sheet, I have to split along the : and put everything into hrs, then add them all up and add in the pick up/drop off times and stuff






lon1 = radians(self.df[self.df['Location'] == self.start_loc.currentText()]['long'])
      lon2 = radians(self.df[self.df['Location'] == self.end_loc.currentText()]['long'])
      lat1 = radians(self.df[self.df['Location'] == self.start_loc.currentText()]['lat'])
      lat2 = radians(self.df[self.df['Location'] == self.end_loc.currentText()]['lat'])
      dlon = lon2 - lon1
      dlat = lat2 - lat1
      a = sin(dlat / 2)**2 + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * sin(dlon / 2)**2
      c = 2 * asin(sqrt(a))
      # Radius of earth in kilometers. Use 3956 for miles
      r = 3956
      v = 125*1.15
      # calculate the result
      take_off_landing_t = 6/60

      total_travel_time = round((c * r/v))

       + take_off_landing_t + self.dur,3
      current_date_and_time = datetime.datetime.now()
      hours_added = datetime.timedelta(hours = total_travel_time)
      est_end_time = current_date_and_time + hours_added
